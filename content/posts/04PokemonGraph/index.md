We have learned from years of watching cartoons and playing video games that the
outcome in a battle is determined by things like speed, health (HP), and
evolutionary stage. Haven’t you seen how many times Goku has evolved over the
last 25 or so years. We all knew that when Goku became Super Saiyan for the
first time Freezer had already lost.

**Figure 1 — Scatter plot of Health vs Pokemon Rank**: The Pokemon’s evolution stage
in shown by the different style of marker and color. The Pokemon’s speed
determines the size of the marker. Pokemon’s with larger speeds have larger markers.
